Key File Descriptions for the TechBio C-Suite CoPilot

# Backend Core Files:

* app.py: The main FastAPI application with all API endpoints
* router_agent.py: Contains the agent routing logic using TxGemma
* synthesis_agent.py: Combines responses from multiple agents
* txgemma_agent.py: The unified molecular agent powered by TxGemma
* memory_manager.py: Manages all types of memory for the system

# Frontend Core Files:

* frontend/src/App.js: The main React application component
* frontend/src/App.css: Styling for the application
* frontend/public/index.html: HTML template for the React app

# Configuration Files:

* .env: Contains API keys and configuration values
* requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies
* frontend/package.json: Lists all NPM dependencies

These three configuration files are essential for your TechBio CoPilot application:

requirements.txt includes:

*All necessary Python dependencies with specified versions
*Libraries for the FastAPI backend, LangChain, and TxGemma integration
*Data processing libraries for market and investment analysis
*Testing and development utilities

.env includes placeholder values for:

* API keys for OpenAI and TxGemma
* Market data API keys
* Environment settings for development/production
* Server configuration options
* Memory management settings

.gitignore includes patterns to exclude:

* Sensitive files like .env and credentials
* Python cache and virtual environment files
* Memory files (though you can optionally version these)
* Log files and IDE-specific files
* Frontend build artifacts and node_modules

Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the .env file with your actual API keys before running the application. Also, remember that the .env file contains sensitive information, so it's excluded from Git in the .gitignore file to prevent accidentally committing your API keys.

# Storage:

* memory/: Directory where all agent memories and conversations are stored
* The memory manager will create this directory structure if it doesn't exist

# Testing:

* tests/integration_test.py: Tests the entire workflow
* tests/unit_tests/: Contains tests for individual components

This structure allows for a modular approach, where each component is clearly separated and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
